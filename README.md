This is just a small MVC web application consuming the github API

I am playing with the following technologies:

	Front-end
	- Clean responsive design with Bootstrap
	- Angular 1.6
	
	Back-end
	- .Net MVC 5.2.3
	- RestSharp for communication with GitHub Api
	- Unit testing with NSubstitute for mocking
